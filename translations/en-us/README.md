👋 Hey, this is Layner!

🚀 I'm the COO and a partner at eSolution, where we lead technological innovation to revolutionize tourism and hospitality in Brazil. But outside the office, I transform into an avid developer who loves to play with code and explore new technologies.

### 🎢 About me in the dev world
When I'm not busy being an executive, I dedicate my time to developing personal projects and collaborating on open-source initiatives. My professional experience with SóFalta.Eu, a super innovative ticket sales engine, and SóFalta.Eu Pay, a payment aggregator, gives me a unique edge in developing solutions that make a difference. Yes, I love to dive into data and squeeze every drop of efficiency to enhance the user experience.

### 🛠️ 🛠️ Tools and technologies
My heart belongs to .NET and C#. These tools are my favorites and where I truly feel I can bring my ideas to life. I love the robustness and efficiency that .NET provides, and exploring all the features of C# to create applications that are not only powerful but also elegant.

### 💡 Innovation as a hobby
Innovation is not just a part of my job; it's my passion. I believe that small innovations can lead to major transformations, and that's what I strive for with every line of code I write in my spare time.

### 🤝 Let's collaborate
I'm always looking for new challenges and love to collaborate with interesting people and exciting projects. If you have an idea that can change the world, or just make it a little more fun, give me a shout!
